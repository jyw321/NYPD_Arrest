## Felony-based Arrests in New York City during COVID-19 Pandemic in 2020 ##
[NYPD report](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/news/p0106a/overall-crime-new-york-city-reaches-record-low-2020) shows that the overall crime in New York City reaches record low in 2020 during the pandemic. However, at the same time, NYPD also stressed that such decrease of crime rate is accompanied by significant upticks in homicides, shootings, burglaries and car thefts. A [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/nyregion/nyc-2020-crime-covid.html) points out that, the increased crime cases, such as shootings have doubled, and most of them were concentrated in the areas hardest hit by the coronavirus and unemployment.


According to the [COVID-19 Data by ZIP Code](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data-totals.page#zip) released by the health department, Staten Island, Bronx and Queens are the three boroughs that got most seriously hit by the disease (rate per 100,000 people).


In this project, I am going to focus on NYPD's record of arrests on felony counts in New York City during the height of pandemic (March - December 2020). Though arrest does not necessarily lead to judiciary crime, NYPD's arrest record provides us a relatively comprehensive account to see the immediate changes in the city during the pandemic.


My research questions are:
Did New York City show an increased number of arrests on felony counts during the pandemic in 2020?
What types of arrests on felony counts were mostly recorded?
Who were arrested on those felony counts? (demographic characteristics)
Where did those arrests on felony counts usually happen?
Does the location of those arrests on felony counts correspondent to the areas most seriously hit by the pandemic?


The datasets I am going to rely on include:
[NYPD Arrests Data (Historic)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u)
[NYPD precinct map](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Police-Precincts/78dh-3ptz)
[COVID-19 Data by Date](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page#epicurve)
It is also important to note that, the NYPD arrest record inevitably shows establishment institutional bias.
